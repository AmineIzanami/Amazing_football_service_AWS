# Amazing_football_service_AWS
In this project i made an architecture for a company service which its main mission is to provide statistics and analytics of the most promising players to the talent scouts in the global market, so that the scouts can locate and contact them. In order to perform these analyses, they currently rely on 3 data sources: player_attributes, player_personal and player_positions. These sources are inserted manually into a relational database. Analysts query this database to extract the 11 most promising players under 25 years old, and afterward represent the results on a world map where each player may be located. 	 The CTO of the company is looking to re-design their technology infrastructure. He is committed to take advantage of the Cloud and get benefit from the scalability, agility, cost reduction and reduced maintenance efforts that AWS provides.
